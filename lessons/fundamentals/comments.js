/* 
In javascript comments are used for:
- Explaining lines of code
- Adding readability
- Exclude some lines of code from being executed

Note: comments may feel unneccessary but will help you and other developers to understand your code. It will also help prevent confusion when going back to the application after a break. It can also be searchable so if you are looking for a certain section of code you can search for a comment for quick reference.
